## Project Overview
Customer churn, or the loss of clients or customers, is a critical issue that impacts a companyâ€™s profitability. This project predicts customer churn by analyzing customer behavior patterns, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and behavioral metrics. It has been preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring high-quality data for model training.

## Objectives
- Predict customer churn with high accuracy.
- Identify key factors influencing customer churn.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn and safeguard revenue.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data for better model performance.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the distribution and relationships within the data.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Selection:** Evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms.
5. **Evaluation and Interpretation:** Analyzing model performance and extracting business insights.
